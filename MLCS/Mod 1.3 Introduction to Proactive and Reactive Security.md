## Proactive Security
- **Definition:** Prevents attacks before they occur by anticipating threats and addressing vulnerabilities.
- **Key Strategies:**
    - Regular security audits and penetration testing
    - Strong access controls and encryption
    - Continuous system monitoring for suspicious activity
    - Timely software and hardware updates
    - Employee cybersecurity awareness training
    - Risk analysis and layered protection
- **Benefits:**
    - Reduces overall risk and crisis situations
    - Cost-effective in the long run
    - Improves compliance with regulations
    - Prevents inside jobs and finds flaws early
    - Enables faster response to emerging threats

---

## Reactive Security
- **Definition:** Responds to threats and incidents after they have occurred, focusing on damage control and recovery.
- **Key Strategies:**
    - Incident detection and response plans
    - Forensic analysis to understand breaches
    - Remediation: patching systems, updating protocols
    - Threat detection and log monitoring
    - Restoring compromised systems
    - Communicating with stakeholders post-incident
- **Benefits:**
    - Limits damage after an incident
    - Helps identify weaknesses for future improvement
    - Essential for rapid recovery and business continuity

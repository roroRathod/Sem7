| Structure   | Directed acyclic graph (nodes: variables, edges: dependencies)                      |
| Data Used   | Network traffic, system logs, attack signatures, audit data                         |
| Output      | Probability of attack, classification (benign/malicious)                            |
| Learning    | Structure learning (graph), parameter learning (conditional probabilities)          |
| Reasoning   | Probabilistic inference given evidence (observed features)                          |
| Strengths   | Handles uncertainty, adapts to new data, supports both misuse and anomaly detection |
| Limitations | Computationally intensive for large networks, needs quality data                    |

## Bayesian Network in Misuse/Signature Detection

- **Signature-Based Detection:** BNs encode known attack patterns as conditional dependencies between features and attack nodes. Incoming data is checked against these patterns, and the network computes the probability of an attack given observed evidence.
- **Anomaly-Based Detection:** BNs are trained on normal behavior data. Deviations from expected patterns (low probability under the BN) are flagged as potential anomalies or attacks.
- **Hybrid Models:** Combine feature selection (e.g., information gain, chi-squared) with BN classifiers (K2, Tabu Search, Hill Climbing, Tree-Augmented Naive Bayes) for robust detection and reduced false alarms.
- **Dynamic Updating:** BNs can be updated in real-time as new attack signatures or behaviors are discovered, supporting adaptive security frameworks.

## Typical Workflow Table

|Step|Description|
|---|---|
|Data Collection|Gather network logs, system calls, audit trails|
|Feature Selection|Identify relevant attributes using entropy/statistical methods|
|Structure Learning|Build BN graph using search algorithms (K2, Tabu, Hill Climbing)|
|Parameter Learning|Estimate conditional probability tables from data|
|Detection/Inference|Compute attack probability given observed evidence|
|Alert/Response|Trigger alerts if attack probability exceeds threshold|

## Example BN Algorithm for Signature Detection
```python
from pgmpy.models import BayesianNetwork
from pgmpy.estimators import K2Score, HillClimbSearch
# Define structure
model = BayesianNetwork([('Feature1', 'Attack'), ('Feature2', 'Attack')])
# Fit parameters
model.fit(data)
# Inference
prob = model.predict_probability({'Feature1': 1, 'Feature2': 0})
```

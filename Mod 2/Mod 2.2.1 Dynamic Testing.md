## Black Box Testing

Black box testing is a **dynamic software testing technique** where the tester is only concerned with the functional behavior of the software, not its internal code or logic. The software is treated as a “black box,” with only inputs and outputs visible, and the goal is to determine whether it operates according to specifications.

**Key Features and Objectives**
- **Functionality Focus:** Black box testing is used to check that the system’s required functions behave as specified, regardless of the underlying code.
- **Specification-Based:** Test cases are created from requirements or user stories, not from knowledge of the code.
- **No Code Required:** Testers do not need to understand programming or internal implementation.
- **Role:** Typically performed by independent testers or users, ensuring unbiased tests.    

**Types of Black Box Testing**
- **Functional Testing:** Verifies that each function of the software operates according to requirements.
- **Non-functional Testing:** Examines aspects such as performance, usability, and scalability.

**Common Black Box Testing Techniques**
 [[Mod 2.2.1.a Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)]]
- Tests software at the edges/boundaries of input domains.
- Example: For an input range 1–100, tests would include values 1, 100, 0, and 101.
- Most errors are found at the boundaries, so BVA is highly effective.

[[Mod 2.2.1.b Equivalence Class Partitioning]]
- Divides input data into valid and invalid partitions (equivalence classes).
- Tests only representatives from each class, reducing the total number of test cases needed.

[[Mod 2.2.1.c Decision Table Testing]]
- Uses tables to represent combinations of inputs and corresponding expected outputs for complex business logic.

[[Mod 2.2.1.d State-Based Testing]]
- Designs test cases based on software’s possible states and state transitions.

[[Mod 2.2.1.e Cause-Effect Graphing]]
- Models logical relationships between causes (inputs) and effects (outputs) and derives test cases accordingly.

 **Advantages of Black Box Testing**
- **Requires no code knowledge**: Testers can be end-users or domain specialists.
- **Unbiased**: No risk of tester prejudice from code structure.
- **Efficient for large systems**: Ideal for validating user requirements and high-level software behavior.

**Disadvantages of Black Box Testing**
- **Limited Coverage:** Not all program paths or logic covered; some errors in code structure may go undetected.
- **Redundant Tests:** Different testers may repeat the same tests unknowingly.
- **Difficult to Trace Failure Causes:** Diagnosing sources of errors is harder without access to code.
- **Dependent on Documentation:** Quality and completeness of requirements/specifications directly affect test quality.

**Typical Black Box Testing Process**
- **Requirement Review:** Understand functional requirements thoroughly.
- **Test Case Design:** Use techniques mentioned above (BVA, ECP, etc.) to prepare test cases that cover expected and unexpected inputs.
- **Execution:** Run tests, feed inputs, record outputs, and compare with expected results.
- **Result Analysis:** Failures are logged, and outputs are validated against the requirements.

**Applications and Coverage**
Black box techniques are especially useful for:
- **System Testing:** Validating complete software systems before release.
- **Acceptance Testing:** Ensuring system meets user needs and business requirements.
- **Regression Testing:** Checking that software still works correctly after changes, without looking into the code.

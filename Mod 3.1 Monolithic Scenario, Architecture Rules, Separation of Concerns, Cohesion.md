## A. The Monolithic Scenario

1. **Definition**: A monolithic architecture is a single, unified codebase where all components (UI, business logic, data access) are tightly coupled and deployed together.
2. **Key Features**  
    a. One codebase, one deployment unit  
    b. Direct function calls between modules  
    c. Shared memory and resources  
    d. Simple to develop and deploy initially
3. **Challenges**  
    a. Difficult to scale parts independently  
    b. Harder to maintain as codebase grows  
    c. Risk of unintended side effects from changes  
    d. Slower deployments and testing

## B. Architecture Rules of Thumb

| Rule                    | Description                          | Benefit                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Single Responsibility   | One purpose per module               | Easier maintenance         |
| Loose Coupling          | Minimize interdependencies           | Safer changes, flexibility |
| High Cohesion           | Group related functions              | Clarity, reliability       |
| Separation of Concerns  | Distinct sections for distinct tasks | Simpler, less error-prone  |
| Scalability/Flexibility | Design for growth/change             | Future-proof, adaptable    |

## C. Separation of Concerns

1. **Definition**: Architectural principle that divides a system into distinct sections, each responsible for a specific aspect or functionality.
2. **Key Features**  
    a. UI, business logic, and data access are separated  
    b. Each section can be developed, tested, and maintained independently  
    c. Reduces complexity and improves clarity
3. **Benefits**  
    a. Easier debugging and testing  
    b. Faster development cycles  
    c. Lower risk of unintended side effects

## D. Principle of Cohesion

1. **Definition**: Cohesion measures how closely related the responsibilities of a module or component are.
2. **Types of Cohesion**  
    a. Functional Cohesion: All parts contribute to a single, well-defined task  
    b. Logical Cohesion: Related by type of function (e.g., all input functions)  
    c. Temporal Cohesion: Related by timing (e.g., initialization tasks)
3. **Benefits of High Cohesion**  
    a. Easier to understand, maintain, and reuse modules  
    b. Fewer bugs and side effects  
    c. Improved reliability and clarity

| Type                | Description              | Example                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Functional Cohesion | All parts do one task    | Payment processing module  |
| Logical Cohesion    | Related by function type | Input validation functions |
| Temporal Cohesion   | Related by timing        | Startup initialization     |

Equivalence Class Partitioning (ECP) is a black-box test design technique that divides the input domain of a program into partitions of equivalent data, called **equivalence classes**. Each class represents valid or invalid states for the input conditions, where the system is expected to behave the same way for all values in that class. Instead of testing every possible input, testers select one representative from each class.
### Purpose of Equivalence Class Partitioning
- **Reduce Test Effort:** Focus on representative values instead of exhaustive testing.
- **Increase Defect Detection:** Covers both valid and invalid scenarios systematically.
- **Systematic Coverage:** Ensures diverse input conditions are adequately tested.
### How to Identify Equivalence Classes
- **Range-based Splitting:** For inputs with ranges (e.g., 1–100), create valid and invalid classes (below min, within range, above max).
- **Category Splitting:** For categorical inputs (e.g., A, B, C), create one valid class per category plus one invalid class.
- **Set Membership:** For specific allowed codes, valid = allowed values; invalid = everything else.
- **Must/Should Requirements:** Define classes based on required properties (e.g., first character must be a letter).
- **Output Classes:** Sometimes equivalence classes are formed from expected outputs as well.
### Steps to Apply Equivalence Class Partitioning
1. Identify input conditions from requirements.
2. Partition each input into valid and invalid classes.
3. Assign identifiers to each class.
4. Design test cases:
    - Choose one representative from each valid class.
    - Design individual test cases for each invalid class.
5. Execute and compare results with expected outputs.
**Example:**  
For inputs A, B, C (each 1–50):
- Valid class: 1 ≤ A, B, C ≤ 50
- Invalid classes: A < 1, A > 50, B < 1, B > 50, C < 1, C > 50
Sample test cases:
- (A=0, B=25, C=25) → A invalid
- (A=25, B=51, C=25) → B invalid
- (A=25, B=25, C=25) → all valid
### Advantages of Equivalence Class Partitioning
- Reduces number of test cases significantly.
- Provides systematic, organized coverage.
- Detects input-handling errors effectively.    
- Can be applied to both inputs and outputs.
### Disadvantages of Equivalence Class Partitioning
- Subjective: inexperienced testers may miss important classes.
- Does not handle **boundary values** (needs Boundary Value Analysis).
- Overlooks dependencies between multiple input conditions.
### Best Practices
- Use ECP as a base technique.
- Combine with **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)** for stronger coverage.
- Cover both **valid and invalid** inputs.
- Use other techniques like **Decision Tables** or **Cause-Effect Graphing** for complex scenarios.

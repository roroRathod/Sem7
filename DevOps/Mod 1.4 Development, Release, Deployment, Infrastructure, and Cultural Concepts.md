## A. Development, Release, and Deployment Concepts

| Concept               | Key Features                                  | Benefits                               |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Version Control       | Track changes, merge, restore, collaboration  | Risk reduction, rollback, teamwork     |
| TDD                   | Write tests first, clarify requirements       | Higher code quality, faster feedback   |
| CI                    | Frequent merges, automated builds/tests       | Early bug detection, avoids merge hell |
| CD                    | Automated release pipeline, frequent releases | Reliable, fast deployments             |
| Continuous Deployment | Automated prod deployment, rapid feedback     | Fast learning, customer satisfaction   |
| MVP                   | Minimal product, fast validation              | Reduced waste, quick iteration         |
| Artifact Management   | Store/manage build outputs, versioning        | Dependency control, repeatable builds  |
| Build Automation      | Automate build/test/lint/artifact steps       | Consistency, reliability               |
| Deployment Automation | Automate deployment/configuration             | Speed, error reduction                 |

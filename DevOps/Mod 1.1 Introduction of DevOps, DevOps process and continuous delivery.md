1. **Definition**:  DevOps is a set of practices, cultural philosophies, and tools that integrates software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to increase an organization's ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity.
2. **Goals**: Accelerate software delivery, improve product quality, and enhance collaboration between development and operations teams.
3. **Core Principles**: Automation, collaboration, continuous improvement, and monitoring.
4. **Benefits**: Faster time-to-market, reduced risk, improved reliability, and better customer satisfaction.

## Continuous Delivery (CD)
1. **Definition**: Continuous Delivery is the practice of automatically preparing code changes for release to production, ensuring that software can be reliably released at any time.
2. **Key Features**
    a. Automated build, test, and deployment pipelines
    b. Manual approval gates for production releases
    c. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for environment consistency
    d. Frequent, small batch releases for reduced risk
3. **Benefits**
    a. Faster, safer releases
    b. Improved scalability and repeatability
    c. Reduced downtime and errors

| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Code    | Developers write and organize code using version control tools              |
| Build   | Code is compiled and packaged into deployable format                        |
| Test    | Automated and manual tests ensure code quality and security                 |
| Release | Software is deployed in staging, then rolled out to production              |
| Deploy  | Infrastructure is provisioned, code is released to production               |
| Operate | Application is managed, configured, and maintained in production            |
| Monitor | System performance and user feedback are tracked for continuous improvement |

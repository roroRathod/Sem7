## Keyword Research
- **Purpose:** Identify what terms your target audience uses to find products, services, or information you offer.
- **Sources:** Use search engine suggestions, competitor sites, analytics, and keyword tools.
- **Types of Keywords:**
    - _Broad keywords_: High search volume, high competition (e.g., "shoes").
    - _Narrow/Long-tail keywords_: Lower volume, lower competition, higher conversion (e.g., "red running shoes for women").
- **Tools:** Google Keyword Planner, Microsoft adCenter Labs, Yahoo! keyword tools, and other specialized platforms.

## Keyword Strategy
- **Broad vs. Narrow:**
    - Broad keywords attract more traffic but are harder to rank for.
    - Narrow/long-tail keywords are easier to rank and often convert better.
- **Mix of Keywords:** Use a combination of broad, narrow, and long-tail keywords for balanced traffic and conversions.
- **Content Mapping:** Assign specific keywords to relevant pages; avoid keyword cannibalization.
- **Continuous Review:** Update strategy based on performance and changing trends.

## Traditional Approaches
- **Manual Brainstorming:** List out terms your audience might use.
- **Competitor Analysis:** Check which keywords competitors rank for and target.
- **Basic Tools:** Use free or built-in keyword tools for initial research.
- **Search Engine Suggestions:** Use autocomplete and related searches for ideas.

## The Importance of Word Stemming
- **Definition:** Word stemming involves using root words and their grammatical variations (e.g., "run", "running", "runner").
- **SEO Impact:** Google recognizes stemmed words as relevant, even if not exact matches.
- **Strategy:** Include variations of keywords in your content to capture more search queries and improve perceived relevance.

## Keyword Modifiers: Types & Use
- **Definition:** Modifiers are words added to core keywords to form more specific search phrases.
- **Types:**
    - _Generic modifiers_: "best", "top", "cheap", "online", "free"
    - _Money modifiers_: "buy", "discount", "deal", "price"
    - _Niche modifiers_: Industry-specific terms (e.g., "organic", "handmade", "B2B")
- **Benefits:** Help target user intent, strengthen long-tail keyword strategy, and improve conversion rates.
